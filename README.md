# Esp8266Configuration

This project offers a simple method for handling basic configuration for iot projects. Actually wifi ap/station and mqtt are supported. In future more and user defined values will be supported. Also a user defined storage target will be possible.

This project is for example used in a Esp8266 web configuration project which will be published in Esp8266WebConfiguration soon. This offers a fancy gui for configure the communications, gpio's and rules. Later more management and features and also supported devices will follow.

Current development is delayed caused by an other project. This project will be updated soon for supporting multiple hardware constellations.
